# Distributed File System

## Description
This is a simple implementation of a distributed file system that is inspired by the Google File System research paper (https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf). It is not meant to be used in a production environment and it exists solely for personal academic and learning purposes only.

## Why does this exist?
This is a personal project done for the sake of learning about the challenges of implementing a large scale distributed system. A distributed file system is a very complex piece of software which involves many moving parts. Distributed systems is an area of computing where I seek to learn more, so I found doing such a project to be a great way of learning rather than just reading books or watching lectures. This project has also been a great way for me to gain more exposure to the Go programming language and learn how to do things such as structure a Go project, write unit tests and integration tests in Go, and setting up a continuous integration pipeline.


## Implementation Details

There are three main components of the file system much like that of Google File System: master server, chunk server, and client. 

`Master`

`Chunkserver`

`Client`
